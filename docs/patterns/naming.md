##### Naming Patterns

## Naming things is hard. Make sure your code is readable and has no magic numbers.

* Folders: Folders should be one word that is lowercased. If it cannot be one word then it is probably not general enough for a folder
* Pages: Pages are going to be named the same as the class they contain using camelCase. If there is more than one class per page, consider separating them into different pages.
    * READMEs are an exception that will be all caps. Only create these if you are creting a new folder that could use explaining or examples of how to use what it contains.
    * Tests will be named the same as the file they are testing with .test.py. E.g. example.py => example.test.py
* Classes: Classes will have the same name as their containing page using UpperCase first letters.
* Methods: Methods will be named to describe the job they complete using the under_score pattern. 
* Variables: Variables will be named by the purpose that their values they serve using camelCase.
